- Make a timer, so after X minutes of inactivity, the mode changes to insert. Not sure if a good idea.
- Make a boolean variable, that's true, only when 'v' or 'V' are activated. This way you can use capital letters without fear that it's a 'Shift', left from previous use of 'v' or 'V'.
- Fix shortcuts like Undo and Redo that don't work when the keyboard layout is not english.
